KB Grisby: Task Manager. Make sure tasks are clearly defined, talk with group members to agree on deadlines, make sure group is communicating well with each other, monitor progress, promote collaboration and make sure our goals are met.

Riley Skief: Client Interfacer. I communicated with my partners and our client to find a time when we were all available to meet. I ensured we created (to the best of our ability) exactly what our client envisioned the app to look like and do. I was communicative and encouraged consistent work so our client could follow our progress. We held nearly biweekly meetings with our client to ensure consistent work was done and done on the right path. I started creating buttons and visuals on the main page, but with requests from group members, eventually gravitated to work on the aesthetics and organization of all the pages of our app to bring consistency. I coordinated the logo (acquired from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse website as our client suggested) colors with the app bar and font colors. I also added padding to the text to make it more readable, which was eventually paired with Jack's addition of cards to best display the information.

Jack Smith: Unit Tester. Unit Tester. I will create and maintain unit tests for all components of our application to ensure code quality and catch potential bugs early in development.

Dylan Carter: Integration Tester. I will work on making the API for the database work with the app and troubleshoot issues with it. I will talk with the people in my group so we have a shared vision for the app.

Jayden Grisby: Beta Test Organizer. I will organize the Beta Tests for the app.
