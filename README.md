# Final-Project

KB Grisby: Task Manager. Make sure tasks are clearly defined, talk with group members to agree on deadlines, make sure group is communicating well with each other, monitor progress, promote collaboration and make sure our goals are met.


Riley Skief: Client Interfacer. I will communicate with our client to schedule meetings, as well as ensure we create (to the best of our ability) exactly what they envision the app to consist of. I will encourage consistent work to be done so our client can follow along with our progress. I will also be in charge of creating the pie charts to show where the federal funding is going.


Jack Smith: Unit Tester. Unit Tester. I will create and maintain unit tests for all components of our application to ensure code quality and catch potential bugs early in development.
